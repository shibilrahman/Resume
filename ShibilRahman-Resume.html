        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>As a SailPoint developer, I have 2 years of experience in designing
            and implementing identity and access management solutions using
            SailPoint IdentityIQ. My technical skills include expertise in Java/J2EE,
            JavaScript, SQL, and XML. I have worked on various aspects of
            SailPoint development, including configuring SailPoint workflows,
            building custom connectors, and creating custom rules and policies.
            Overall, my experience as a SailPoint developer has equipped me
            with the technical expertise and knowledge to design and
            implement robust identity and access management solutions using
            SailPoint IdentityIQ.</p>
